# Welcome to My ~~Twist~~ GitHub Profile ‚ú®

Hello! I'm Ms. Boba‚Äîa **tech weaver, educator, community builder**, and resident online [fujoshi](https://fujocoded.com/fujoshi#what-is-a-fujoshi). I‚Äôm passionate about the **social internet**, **fanworks fandom**, **niche online communities**, and‚Äîneither last nor least‚Äî**software**, especially the open source, interoperable, and decentralized kind.  

The bulk of my work revolves around **online social spaces** and **niche subcultures**, as well as **technical education and evangelism** aimed at empowering the members of these spaces. I‚Äôm driven not only by a deep love for the internet but by a firm belief: the only way to build a better, kinder web is to empower its inhabitants in becoming **active participants in its creation**‚Äîand by having fun in the process!

### üèó Among the many things I do, I founded:
- **[FujoCoded, LLC](https://fujocoded.com/):** A company dedicated to empowering niche online subcultures.  
- **[FujoWebDev](https://www.fujoweb.dev/):** The technical education arm of FujoCoded LLC, teaching everything from version control with Git, to how to use a terminal, to decentralized protocols.  
- **[BobaBoard](https://bobaboard.com/):** A community-built, forum-like social software for niche communities, on its way to becoming a sociocratic organization.
